<h1>CHICKENS</h1>
<p><h3><strong>chickens</strong>are animals that are raised for food.</h3> A chicken is a domesticated bird belonging to the chicken-necked pheasant family and is a subspecies of the red-night system. Chickens are one of the most common and widespread livestock, with at least 22.7 billion chickens on Earth as of 2016, according to the U.S. statistics agency Statista, which is overwhelmingly more effective than any other bird.</p> <p><h3>Humans usually raise chickens for food such as meat and eggs, and rarely as <u>pets.</u></h3> Although it is not clear about the origin of chickens, the most likely hypothesis is that wild red night-cats that lived in Southeast Asia around 6000-8000 B.C. were domesticated by humans and became modern chickens.</p> <p>In the West, chickens were originally raised for chicken fights and religious ceremonies, but only after the Hellenistic era passed, they were raised for food. The young animal of a chicken is called a chick.</p>
