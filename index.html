<h1>CATS</h1>
<p><h3><strong>Cats</strong> are <u>pets</u> that are loved a lot by people.</h3>
Cats are mammals belonging to the carnivorous cat family. The cat has been around for about 100,000 to 70,000 years. The origin of domesticated cats is estimated to be African domestic cats that left the forest on their own in the Middle East about 10,000 years ago and settled in a crowded village.</p>

<p><h3>Cats have long been loved by mankind as pets.</h3> For example, in ancient Egyptian murals, there is a picture of a cat being used to hunt birds. The symbiotic relationship between cats and humans is known to have started with mice gathered in warehouses where grain was stored when Egyptian civilization occurred due to the development of agriculture. Therefore, cats have no characteristics of domesticated animals such as livestock, and it is true that they are symbiotic with humans rather than livestock. It then spread throughout Europe and Asia through the Silk Road of Arabian merchants, and also helped them navigate and spread around the world, accompanying humans on the voyage. Although not included in China's duodenum, in Thailand and Vietnam, cats are one of the zodiacs instead of rabbits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 40px;">Some breeds, like the sphinx, have little hair or no tail, like the Mencius. The breeds are divided into Jangmojong, Jungmojong, and Danmojong, and there are Abinian cats, the representative species of Danmo, and Persian cats, the representative species of Jangmojong.</p>

<p>Unlike pet dogs, old habits are alive, and can hide claws, so you can hunt rats, birds, bugs, etc.</p>
