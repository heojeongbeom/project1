<h1>DOGS</h1>
<p><h3><strong>Dogs</strong> are the most beloved <u>pet</u> along with cats.</h3>
Dogs are carnivores and members of the dog family, a subspecies of gray wolves, and are the most widely distributed and most populous terrestrial carnivores in modern times. Dogs are known to be the first animal that mankind has ever domesticated and have historically been raised as pets and hunting dogs.</p>

<p>Mitochondrial DNA analysis has estimated that modern dogs and gray wolves were subdivided about 100,000 years ago, and 2013 analysis using dog fossils suggests that the differentiation occurred between 33,000 and 36,000 years ago.</p>

<p>Dogs were useful in many ways, so most primitive human societies raised them. Dogs are used for hunting, ranching, transportation, and expenses, and are also raised as pets. People have long bred dogs in various breeds to suit these tasks.</p>
